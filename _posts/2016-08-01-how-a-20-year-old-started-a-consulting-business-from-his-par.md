  How a 20 Year Old Started A Consulting Business From His Parents Garage In New
  Zealand, Moved To Manhattan And Made Over $100,000 In Just Six Months! Last
  year I was decided To Start Playing DFS on Fanduel and Draftkings. For a
  couple months i was striking out (literally) I would research the way I felt
  would give me an edge and I was losing much more than I was making. Then, one
  day I crafted a Simple 3- Step Research guideline For Myself to Maximize my
  daily lineup's potential and it caught fire! 1 win, 2 wins, 3 wins and then it
  was rocking and I was winning so much I had to share this. From $25, Over the
  next 2 months I made $7000. The next month - $12,000. The next $22,625. The
  next - $32,000 and now this month (July) I have already made $45,000 and we're
  only a couple days in. I traded in my old run down car for my dream car, BRAND
  NEW . Friends and People started noticing my results and talking about my
  story and before long I had people asking me to teach them how to start
  playing DFS using my 3- Step Research and how to make wild amounts of money .
  At first I said "No" because I honestly didn't believe that anybody else could
  apply what I was doing. I thought I was unique and that nobody else would be
  able to make it work. But this one guy Rodrigo just wouldn't give up and he
  was consistent as hell! He would email me 2-3 times per day telling me he
  wanted to learn my methods and that he was even willing to pay me. After a few
  months of non-stop messages I gave in and decided to try teaching my methods
  to Stanley. I didn't even think it would work for him but he begged me to do
  it... We jumped on Skype calls twice per week and I taught him my process from
  start to finish. Within three weeks I couldn't believe it... Stanley won his
  first $10,000. I almost fell off my chair! Stanley went from knowing NOTHING
  about DFS or sports in general and within three weeks he deposited his first
  amount for $10,000. I wondered if this could be replicated again so I accepted
  2 more people and showed them how to do it and then BAM - they started winning
  too! Then I started working with more people, the groups grew from 10 to 20 to
  30 and I kept teaching them my same methods and they kept getting results.
  Fast Forward to this current day and I now have 41 partners making tens of
  thousands of dollar incomes from my advice and trainings. It's honestly hard
  to believe how this happened so fast.How have I created extreme liquid wealth
  for myself and my clients in such a short time? Well it all comes down to
  relentless focus on 3 Key things... We live in an ADD world where there is too
  much information and too many distractions. While others have tried to do it
  all - I have tried to do less. In the modern world it's more about what your
  ignore rather than what you do. While others burn themselves out trying to do
  52 different things I focus on 3. Want to know what these 3 key things are? I
  spent the past week putting together a free training for you showing you
  *exactly* how I got started and grew my consulting business into the millions.
  I literally pull back the curtain and reveal it all including the "3 Key
  Things" that have been the foundation of my success and my students success.
